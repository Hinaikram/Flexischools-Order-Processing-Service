# Flexischools Order-Processing Service Architecture

## Overview

The Flexischools order-processing service is designed as a modern, serverless architecture that provides high availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for processing school meal orders. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, component interactions, and design decisions.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Serverless-First
- Minimize operational overhead through managed services
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Automatic scaling without manual intervention
- Built-in high availability and fault tolerance

### 2. Event-Driven Design
- Asynchronous processing for improved performance
- Loose coupling between components
- Resilient to failures and traffic spikes
- Scalable message processing

### 3. Security by Design
- Least privilege access principles
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Network isolation and security groups
- Centralized secrets management
